MNG-145,Thu May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,this probably relates to repository work as much as Maven work. Currently  if users wish to use a mirror of ibiblio  they specify that as an alternative remote repository. In m1  this causes a problem because if you add a new repository not equivalent to that in your project  it is not in the build.properties. In m2  they are all added to the list  so the mirror will be used first  but the others may also be checked. This is better  but still requires the user specify it in their configuration and it may be used on projects it is never needed for. It would be good if we could have a repository descriptor at the base of the repository that lists mirrors. On first use of the repository  the user could be prompted to select any mirrors they'd like to use  and it can be saved in their configuration for that repository ID. That way any project listing ibiblio as a repository could actually use  say  planetmirror instead (and fall back to ibiblio last).,Major,Brett Porter,brettporter,Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 EST 2005,[MNG-145] built in notion of a mirror repository,Closed,improvement

I think the project descriptor has big potential as a solid reference vehicle  with the added info.  I would value that more than many of the "guides". For a simple example  the &lt;packaging&gt; element doesn't describe valid values  so a search begins to learn them.  Viewing the schema doesn't help  as the packaging type is "string".  Additionally  I think the phrase "type of artifact" is not intuitive to newbies  so listing the valid values would bring contextual explanation  as well as their definition.

Unfortunately such POMs cannot be used as modules  since the value of the module tag is defined as a directory to another pom.xml instead of a pathname to another POM. Only if the value is not already an existing file the value should be treated as directory with a present pom.xml file. Similar situation applies to the relativePath element of the parent tag. This makes the generation of different artifacts from the same sources (with some modifications) much more easy.

The separation into directories according to function (src/share  src/core  src/web) is currently not supported by Maven. It is highly recommended that sub-directories be used under src/." The Maven Conventions Page (http://maven.apache.org/reference/conventions.html) advises that projects should follow another directory structure: src/main/$LANGUAGE  src/test/$LANGUAGE  src/site/xdocs  etc.  To me this seems to contradict the statement that Maven doesn't support separation into directories according to function.  The examples given of structures to avoid (src/core and src/web) match closely to what's encouraged elsewhere (src/main and src/site). The directory layout page is marked as being for v1.0.2  but the conventions page is not marked with a version.  If the conventions are different for different versions  clearer labeling is needed.

MNG-217,Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EST 2005,Fixed,Currently  the mojos use a parameter map. Setting this up is a little tedious and can be error prone. The parameters can be populated as fields. This will make them simpler to develop and less error prone. It should also facilitate easier use of complex configuration like lists and nested objects using the existing plexus configuration technique. It may be appropriate to move the qdox tags to the parameters themselves  reducing the need for as much configuration  but that is a secondary task - to be opened later after more thought. If possible the request should be removed (the log can be made a part of AbstractPlugin - need to check anything else in the request that might not suit this). The reponse can already be removed and made into a return type as it only has one object within it. THis greatly simplifies the interface to: public PluginExecutionResult execute()   throws PluginExecutionException; ,Major,Brett Porter,brettporter,Sat Mar 19 00:00:00 EST 2005,[MNG-217] change mojos to per-lookup - use fields instead of req parms,Closed,improvement

However the user can call directly the report mojo and in that case the canGenerateReport() method is not called automatically. Thus the solution for a plugin developer is to write: public void executeReport() {     if (canGenerateReport() )     {          [...]     } } Which means that the canGenerateReport method is going to be called twice when mvn site is executed.,Major,John Casey,jdcasey,Wed Mar 29 00:00:00 EST 2006,[MNG-2188] Report mojos should check canGenerateReport() when called directly,Closed,improvement

We have an international team and I like the fact that we can see on the maven generated web site's team list what time it is for a specific developer.  What I am missing is the automatic adjustment for example for my time zone which is in winter times -8 and in summer times -7.  I just made a global search and replace in my pom.xml but actually it would be more convenient maven could do that for me. Is there anything that helps me solving the problem or is this worth an enhancement request?

MNG-273,Tue May 03 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,Currently  the marmalade-mojo stuff works by having one generic class that extends from o.a.m.p.AbstractPlugin  and is responsible for setting up the context  building the marmalade script  and executing it. When this script wrapper is converted to the new mojo injection method for setting parameters  we will lose the ability for a script to receive parameters from maven (since the generic class will not have those parameter fields to satisfy every script). In order to enable scripted mojos going forward  develop a new way of handling the plugin configuration (actually mojo configuration  inheriting from the plugin config) as a whole. This includes optional injection of the whole configuration into a single field in the mojo-script wrapper class  and new methods to make navigation of the configuration easier. If the configuration object has some coercion executed on it before parameters are normally injected  an analogous process needs to happen before this whole-configuration object is injected into the mojo wrapper. So  to summarize: Develop new "whole-configuration" object type and expression Add convenience methods for navigating the "whole-configuration" instance from a script Add coercion to the "whole-configuration" object's construction  to mimick the behavior of individually injected parameters. ,Critical,John Casey,jdcasey,Fri Apr 08 00:00:00 EDT 2005,[MNG-273] Add ability to handle plugin configuration as a single unit for context-based [scripted] mojos,Closed,improvement

For the record  I tried to enhance Plexus' ComponentSetDescriptor  but found I could only access the source (parameter) in 2 out of 5 places without API modification  so I abandoned this approach but it might prove wise to include the source there  rather than in the special case of maven's PluginManager.,Minor,null,null,Sat May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2005,[MNG-371] PluginDescriptor location enhancement,Closed,improvement

MNG-521,Wed Jul 27 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,Currently m2 pom require to have explicit version of the parent pom in all submodules. This should work fine for "standalone" artifacts. However there is different type of projects (e.g. EAR) that is usually stored in version control as a whole thing and may contain multiple modules (ejb jars  rar  war  etc) that are build with the same version as entire EAR. So  EAR application released with a single global version for all submodules. In m1 this was possible to specify relative path to parent pom and use version substitution in child modules and deployer goal was substituting values for version numbers upon deployment. For this kind of modules it is very important to have single palce that will have global version number  which then used for submodules. It is also make sense to kee optional relative path (that can be also removed/replaced with concrete parent id/version upon deployment) to support local build. I believe this is very important for J2EE builds as well as any other projects that are releasing multiple artifacts/jars under the same version  (e.g. ASM  XDoclet).,Blocker,John Casey,jdcasey,Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 EDT 2005,[MNG-521] Version inheritance from the parent pom,Closed,improvement

Maybe something can be done using the src/test/project/some-project/.... approach seen in maven-javadoc-plugin  maven-site-plugin and maven-eclipse-plugin (i'd like to see some of that standardized anyway to allow plugin testing generally - which can also be seen as integration testing).

MNG-643,Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,m2 currently supports FileSets in &lt;resources&gt; and &lt;testResources&gt; which allow for the inclusion and exclusion of files based on a pattern. Users may benefit from having this functionality in the source and testSource directory definitions as well. Here are some scenarios: 1) a volative package of java files may be excluded from a build to permit developers to continue building the other source files without having to delete or resolve issues for the problem files. 2) Source files and test source files may be kept in the same source tree in the same manner that resources and testResources may currently be kept in a single directory. 3) The change will allow for a parent pom.xml which applies a custom plugin against all source files for subprojects (modules) and subprojects which only compile subsets of these files to all point at the same directory. 4) Some development environments keep their source files in a single directory regardless of the deployment breakout. One reason is it isn't always obvious which artifact a particular source file is located in and consolidation eliminates the need to look around. 5) Elegant way of continuing to maintain Maven's one project one source set mantra in a multi-project environment without increasing the number of source directories. In an effort to avoid breaking the existing pom format  the following tags would be supported:      &lt;sourceDirectory&gt;../../src/java&lt;/sourceDirectory&gt; xor       &lt;source&gt;          &lt;directory&gt;../../src/java&lt;/directory&gt;          &lt;includes&gt;            &lt;include&gt;*/package/.java&lt;/include&gt;          &lt;/includes&gt;          &lt;excludes&gt;            &lt;exclude&gt;**/*Test.java&lt;/exclude&gt;          &lt;/excludes&gt;      &lt;/source&gt; and       &lt;testSourceDirectory&gt;../../src/java&lt;/testSourceDirectory&gt; xor       &lt;testSource&gt;          &lt;directory&gt;../../src/java&lt;/directory&gt;          &lt;includes&gt;            &lt;include&gt;**/*Test.java&lt;/include&gt;          &lt;/includes&gt;      &lt;/testSource&gt; This issue is NOT endorsing the support of multiple source directories. It would simply be possible to exclude some source files from the single directory.  The change creates a path for deprecating the existing format later if desired. The change would not break existing pom.xml files. If a patch is not included with this issue  expect one soon. This f is a blocker for our development environment because we have several critical tools which traverse all source files in a company project  not just a single artifact's files.

MNG-715,Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,Currently  most aspects of mojo development accommodate some sort of deprecation process. Methods can be deprecated using standard Java language support  and any given mojo can declare one of its parameters as deprecated. However  we do not currently support deprecation of the parameters available to mojo developers. A case in point is $ {project.build.resources}. Ideally  we should not be modifying the underlying Model at runtime; doing so will compromise our ability to write a fully resolved POM to disk (which should not encompass runtime additions  which could be dependent on a profile's activation) and similar functionality. Instead  to add resources and then access them  a mojo should use ${project.resources} and MavenProject.addResource(..) (both new). The most graceful way to encourage this switch would be to deprecate ${project.build.resources}  from the parameter evaluator  and remove it later. Currently  this requires case-by-case exceptions to be coded directly into the PluginParameterExpressionEvaluator  which is not very elegant. One possible solution might be to simply put a list of deprecated expressions into the evaluator  and also maybe a list of banned expressions. First step in evaluation could be to check vs. these lists  and give appropriate warnings/errors when detected.,Major,John Casey,jdcasey,Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 EDT 2005,[MNG-715] find a scalable way to add deprecation information to parameter expressions,Closed,improvement

MNG-742,Tue Aug 23 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,Added functionality to the maven-archiver plugin so that other plugins can add custom manifest entries.  Made some fairly minor changes to both MavenArchiveConfiguration.java and MavenArchiver.java.  Description of changes below  and I've attached my marked up changes to the M2 HEAD of both files. MavenArchiveConfiguration.java ========================= Added the following methods (along with appropriate imports):         private Map manifestEntries = new HashMap(); public void addManifestEntry(Object key  Object value)  { manifestEntries.put(key  value); } public void addManifestEntries(Map map)  { manifestEntries.putAll(map); } public boolean isManifestEntriesEmpty()  { return manifestEntries.isEmpty(); } public Map getManifestEntries()  { return manifestEntries; } Changes maintain a collection of custom manifest entries stored a name-value pairs.  Plugins use the first two methods to add custom manifest entries to the collection.  MavenArchiver uses the last two methods to retrieve the set of entries and add them to the archive's manifest. =============== MavenArchiver.java =============== In the createArchive() method of MavenArchiver  added the following marked code block to retrieve the custom manifest entries (if any available) from the MavenArchiveConfiguration and add them to the archive's manifest.         Manifest manifest = getManifest( project  archiveConfiguration.getManifest() ); // THIS IS THE START OF THE CODE BLOCK I ADDED // any custom manifest entries in the archive configuration manifest? if (!archiveConfiguration.isManifestEntriesEmpty()) { Map entries = archiveConfiguration.getManifestEntries(); Set keys = entries.keySet(); for (Iterator iter = keys.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); )  { String key = (String) iter.next(); String value = (String) entries.get(key); Manifest.Attribute attr = new Manifest.Attribute(key  value); manifest.addConfiguredAttribute(attr); } } // THIS IS THE END OF THE CODE BLOCK I ADDED         // Configure the jar         archiver.addConfiguredManifest( manifest );,Critical,Brett Porter,brettporter,Mon Aug 15 00:00:00 EDT 2005,[MNG-742] Added functionality to maven-archiver so plug-ins can add custom entries to the archiver's manifest,Closed,improvement

MNG-753,Fri Aug 26 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,In our Maven 1.0.2 build environment  we went to the trouble of building a replica of the ibiblio repository on a local machine because we would have builds hang for minutes if ibiblio decided to hiccup while the build was trying to update the snapshots of our current projects. It would be nice if Maven 2 would look for dependencies in the local repositories (those defined in the project and parent POMs) before looking in the central repository.  This would allow locally-produced artifacts to be found faster (especially if the internet connection is dial-up) and would probably also reduce the load on the ibiblio servers.,Minor,Brett Porter,brettporter,Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 EDT 2005,[MNG-753] Check for artifacts in POM-defined repositories before checking the central repository,Closed,improvement

There are still some todos in the code  which probably some M2 guru could look at  but anyway all the existing functionalities continue to work and some other tests have been added.

MNG-806,Mon Sep 12 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,Sun SDKs have a tools.jar that provides API for extending the Sun java tools. This includes APT and Javadoc. There is no mechanism in maven for loading in tools.jar as a dependency. It can be added to the classpath before maven is launched  or manually loaded into the local repository. However  neither of these solutions are very satisfactory. Could we have some smarts in the dependency loading that understands a magical jdk groupId that resolves to the current JDK being used for compilation? This would let JDK-dependent stuff be linked in. In the case of tools.jar  the dependency snippet would look something like this: &lt;dependency&gt;   &lt;groupId&gt;sun.jdk&lt;/groupId&gt;   &lt;artifactId&gt;tools&lt;/artifactId&gt;   &lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;   &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt;,Major,John Casey,jdcasey,Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 EDT 2005,[MNG-806] tools.jar needs to be supported as a normal dependency,Closed,improvement

MNG-91,Fri Dec 24 00:00:00 EST 2004,Fixed,The plexus container artifact (plexus-0.17-SNAPSHOT) has been separated into three pieces: plexus-container-api is the artifact which contains the container API defined by the plexus system; plexus-utils is the artifact which contains common utilities in plexus; and plexus is still the standard container implementation. All of the new artifacts outlined above have the version 0.18-SNAPSHOT to distinguish them from the 0.17-* integrated lineage. To maintain compatibility with the new definition of plexus containers (separated API and utilities)  we need to migrate all maven2 builds to use these three artifacts rather than just plexus-0.17-SNAPSHOT. This will require migrating all plexus-0.17-SNAPSHOT dependency declarations to plexus-container-api-0.18-SNAPSHOT. Depending on the particular build  it MAY also involve re-addition of the standard container: plexus-0.18-SNAPSHOT (for standard container-specific APIs). Depending on the particular build  it MAY also involve addition of the utilities artifact: plexus-utils-0.18-SNAPSHOT (to accommodate usage of the DAG for instance).
