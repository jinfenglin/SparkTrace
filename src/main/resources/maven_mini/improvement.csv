MNG-1,Thu May 19 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,1. artifacts in mevenide to synchronize pom with ide we need to display artifacts if they are not already added to ide (and vice-versa). for that purpose we need to have a comparison mechanism. so a equals() method is needed  but also other utility methods like (non exhaustive) :  o myArtifact.conflicts(myOtherArtifact) and o myArtifact.relaxEquals(myOtherArtifact) f.i. conflicts would return true if same groupId and sameAritfactId but incompatible version  relaxEquals would return true if version is compatible  etc.. (just some quick thoughts) 2. directories  although not as needed as artifact comparison it would be util to have utility to compare a Resource with a given path that might be relative or to $ {basedir}  or absolute.,Minor,null,null,Tue Apr 13 00:00:00 EDT 2004,[MNG-1] directory and artifact comparison,Closed,improvement
