MNG-1,Thu May 19 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,1. artifacts in mevenide to synchronize pom with ide we need to display artifacts if they are not already added to ide (and vice-versa). for that purpose we need to have a comparison mechanism. so a equals() method is needed  but also other utility methods like (non exhaustive) :  o myArtifact.conflicts(myOtherArtifact) and o myArtifact.relaxEquals(myOtherArtifact) f.i. conflicts would return true if same groupId and sameAritfactId but incompatible version  relaxEquals would return true if version is compatible  etc.. (just some quick thoughts) 2. directories  although not as needed as artifact comparison it would be util to have utility to compare a Resource with a given path that might be relative or to $ {basedir}  or absolute.,Minor,null,null,Tue Apr 13 00:00:00 EDT 2004,[MNG-1] directory and artifact comparison,Closed,improvement

MNG-1090,Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 EDT 2005,Fixed,the plugin version manager should be searching the reactorProjects collection before it tries against the repository system  in order to pickup plugins that are going to be built in this maven execution. The only trick here is ensuring that the plugins actually are built ahead of their invocation...,Major,John Casey,jdcasey,Tue Oct 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005,[MNG-1090] search reactorProjects for plugin versions before going to the repository system,Closed,improvement

MNG-1117,Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 EST 2007,Fixed,Currently MavenEmbedder.writeModel( w  model) method does not take into account formatting of the existing pom.xml.

MNG-1119,Sun Dec 27 00:00:00 EST 2009,Fixed,Currently all dependencies come from MavenEmbedder.readProjectWithDependencies() method that is using passed pom.xml to resolve dependencies from m2 repositories. It is possible that some of the dependencies could exist as other Eclipse projects in the same workspace. It would be interesting to hook up Eclipse-specific pom resolver  so it would implement IDE-specific logic to check if there are poms avaialble and if nothing is there use default resolution strategy.,Major,null,null,Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 EDT 2005,[MNG-1119] Allow to use custom pom resolution strategy,Closed,improvement
